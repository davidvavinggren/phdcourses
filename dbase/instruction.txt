i want you to add this {school/course} in {school/course}.json on the same 
format as the others, that is
{
      "year": 
      "semester": {SPRING/SUMMER/FALL/WINTER}
      "code": 
      "credits":
      "title": {title [x credits]}
      "url": 
      "description": 
}.
if you find no credit information, don't add this to the title.if you dont find 
enough description, feel free to elaborate a little on the theme of the course
to make the description more appealing, but keep it rather brief.
also, if you can find when the course is expected to be given, add this to the 
description as well. i want the description on the following format (if all info
is available):
{short summary of course content}; course expected to take place 
{Month - Month year (no exact days)} at {university}.
